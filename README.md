## Database Schema

### Books Table

- `id`: Primary key (auto-increment)
- `title`: Book title (required, unique)
- `author`: Book author (optional)
- `isbn`: ISBN number (optional)
- `available`: Availability status (1 = available, 0 = borrowed)
- `date_added`: Timestamp when book was added

### Borrowed Table

- `id`: Primary key (auto-increment)
- `student_name`: Name of the student who borrowed the book
- `book_title`: Title of the borrowed book
- `borrow_date`: Timestamp when book was borrowed
- `return_date`: Timestamp when book was returned (NULL if not returned)

## Configuration

The application can be customized by modifying `config.py`:

- **Admin Credentials**: Change default username/password
- **UI Colors**: Customize the color scheme
- **Validation Rules**: Set maximum lengths for various fields
- **Default Settings**: Configure borrowing periods and limits

## Dependencies

- **tkinter**: GUI framework (included with Python)
- **sqlite3**: Database (included with Python)
- **Pillow**: Image processing for QR codes
- **qrcode**: QR code generation

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This application is designed for educational and small-scale use. For production environments:

1. Change the default admin credentials in `config.py`
2. Implement proper password hashing
3. Add user session management
4. Consider using a more robust database system
5. Implement proper logging and audit trails

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'PIL'" error**

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

2. **"No module named 'qrcode'" error**

   ```bash
   pip install qrcode
   ```

3. **Database errors**

   - Delete `library.db` file and restart the application
   - The database will be recreated automatically

4. **QR code generation fails**
   - Ensure the `qr_codes` directory has write permissions
   - Check that Pillow is properly installed

### Performance Tips

- The application creates QR codes in the `qr_codes` directory
- Regularly backup the `library.db` file
- For large libraries (1000+ books), consider database optimization
